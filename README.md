# Hyperspectral Tutorial

Sample analysis of a hyperspectral image. In this case, a corn kernel. 
Hyperspectral image is normalized to white and dark reference data, hyperspectral image is masked using the pseudo-rgb, a histogram of spectral reflectance is plotted and two indices are calculated (NDVI and ARI) and pseudocolored images are made.
